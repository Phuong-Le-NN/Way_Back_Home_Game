# Progress Report 3

## Summarize proposed goals and prior feedback
1. What goals did you originally plan to meet by this deadline? How did you delegate tasks to meet those goals?

Goals: Loop back and incorporate the feedback from the demo day
We will be working to adjust our game to feedback that we have from the last report. In this phase we will put the music in and refine our game interface. As the game is coming to an end, we will start thinking about the balance of our game and if there is anything we should do better.

Member’s Responsibility: Everyone will be coding together like pair programming throughout the game but each member may have different side tasks.
Phuong Le: Ensure the game can build with the last level + enhance UI and wrapping up last level if needed
Oghap Kim: Prepare the materials needed with good citation and back-ups. For this level, it will be any extra key and platform and enemies appearance as well as any extra obstacle we decide to add or slides and polishing demo documents we decide to put together.
Caroline Cavalier: Take note throughout the development process and of any changes that we decide to have in the meetings
Annie Pfeufer: Main driver when we pair programming of this level

2. What feedback did you receive on your last progress report? How did you incorporate that feedback?

        One of the main pieces of feedback that we recieved from the second progress report is that we need to update our asset.md file. In order to not be completely scrambling at the very end, we need to add all of the assets that we used to the md file. 
        
        There were a couple pieces of important feedback from the in class game demos, that we thougth was important to take note of here:
        
        The first was incorporating the story more so into the game and maybe adding instruction pages between each of the levels in order to give the player more context. In order to address this, Annie added instruction panels before each level that explained a bit of the story and how to make it through the level. We thought that these acted as good check points in order to stay engaged with the player and keep them on track.
        
        We also got questions about the underworld level, and how it was going to contribute to the story and how it might change the ending. We weren't originally going to keep the level, but when we were working with our composer, he had mentioned that he really enjoyed the level and thought it was an interesting part of the game. Therefore, we deciced to put the underground level between the locked door level and the enemy level. We incorporated this into the story by telling the player that the dog had fallen into the hole. 
        
        There were also questions surrounding the background and platforms - was the dog climbing a mountain, etc? Thinking about the platform assets in the game and how they contribute to the story was an important piece of feedback that we recieved. We wanted to keep the platforms the same on each of the different levels in order to have uniformity throughout the game. What we did add however was a level of randomness to the layout of the platforms on each of the levels. This helps each of the jump maps not be the same each time the player plays the game as well. We wanted the game to be sort of a quest through the woods vibe and we thought that the platform we chose went along with the theme. 
        
        Regarding having the different character options and their different abiltiies, we ultimately decided to keep them somewhat balanced because the two players will have different advantages, such as one of them will be fast but not able to jump as high, and the other one will have the opposite. 
        
        Additionally, we got a reccomendation that we should label the health bar in order to make it more noticeable for the player on the screen. To address this, we decided to add a label to the healthbar in each level.
        
        Finally, we got the question of if there will be squireels in the underworld, and to answer this - no there will not be. We wanted to keep this mechanic of the game uniquely to that level.  


## Evaluate progress made since last progress report
1. Which of the goals you outlined for this point in your last progress report have been met? Which have you made progress toward but not yet met?
    
    The original goals that we outlined in our last progress report include :
    
    
    Original Goal 1 : This includes prioritizing core functionality, refining key features, and enhancing the overall user experience to deliver a more engaging version of the game that closely reflects our vision for the final product. We need to add to these goals by introducing the sound mechanic into the game and learning how to add music into Unity. This is something that we needed to add because we met with our composer this past week and agreed on the soundtrack that would be used for our game. 
    How we have made progress : Addressing the sound mechanic, we have met with our composer and added music to each of the levels that we felt go along with the story and overall player experince of our game. To make the game more engaging, we added checkpoints at each level that the player can engage with that have details about the story and also help explain to the player how to get through the level. We also decided to incorporate an underground level that players might think is interesting cause it looks different from the rest of the game. Although this was kind of a broad original goal, this is some of the ways we addresses it. 
    
    Original Goal 2 : Another way that we need to modify the original goal is to be able to have two options for the character that the player can choose from. Right now, the player can only choose the Corgi, but by the next completion of phase 3, the player should be able to choose from both of the characters. 
    How we have made progress : We were able to get the functionality of the other character to work properly, and also added different abilities to each of the characters to make them slightly different. Overall, the player is now able to choose from both of the character options in the beginning of the game. 

    
    Original Goal 3 : Additonally, we also need to create and end scene that the player will see when they win the game. By incorporating light colors and rewarding sounds, we are hoping these mechanics will make the player feel rewarded and happy that they were able to sucessfully complete the game. 
    How we have made progress : Since we had no end scene in Phase 2, we built and end scene for the game that shows a little house with some flowers, and tells the player that they won the game and made it home. Additionally, there is also a button that allows the player to play again if they decide to and will bring the player back to the beginning.
    
    Original Goal 4 : Lastly, another goal that we have is to add an intstruction page if they player needs help or cannot figure out how to play the game. We were planning to ask about this at the demo to see if it is really necesssary, but is something that we are considering adding to the game.
    How we have made progress : We added instruction pages and checkpoints on each level that both explain the story and give the player hints as to what to do in order to pass the level. 
2. What strategies have been working well for your group? What successes have you had? Are you ready for the showcase?
    
    The same strategy that we have used throughout the entire process of creating the game is a balance between the divide and conquer method, but also meeting together as a whole group. We delegate different parts of the project to each of the team members to work on (these are sort of based on what we have each been working on throughout the duration of the project) and then if there are parts that need help on, we communicate this as we meet as a whole group. Also having a google chat is incredibly helpful for us because even when we are working on the project on our own, we are able to ask questions and update the group on what we have done. Having clear communication and a delegation of tasks has been a very succeesful strategy for us throughout the semester. 

    The successes that we have include getting the character selection to work. This has been something that we have been struggling with to get to work, but now it finally works. Another success that we have add is building upon the story more so in this phase. In the past couple of phases, the story behind our game has not been something that has really come through clearly during the gameplay. The addition of the instruction panels has been very helpful to the story development for our game. Finally, our main success of this phase has been getting our game completely ready for the showcase. Although we wil make changes with feedback we get from the showcase for our final draft, we have been able to get our game to a place that we all feel confident with. 
        
3. Did you run into any issues in this part of this project? What were those issues? What have you done to try to address them?
    The major issues that we were running into was more of the smaller details throughout the levels. Overall, in the debugging this is where we actually found most of the issues that took a lot of time to fix. For example, little things like changing the font, or changing the sprite images and other things that came that were more UI related were smaller issues that we didn't really expect but were able to handle them. We also had to play around with the sponning of the platforms in order to make sure that each level was playable for the player. In dealing with these issues, it wasn't that we didn't figure out how to fix them, it was more of the trial and error process that went along with fixing them. Remaining open minded, and having the expectation that trial and error is an inherent part of the process was a key to our success in this phase. 

## Set/refine goals for next checkpoint
1. What were your original goals for the next checkpoint?
    Here are our goals for progress report 4 that we laid out in our original proposal :
   Goals: We will continue working to adjust our game to feedback that we have from the last report. We may consider doing demo slides, extra documents etc in this phase.
2. Do you need to modify those original goals? If so, what are your new goals?
    This is a good goal to have for phase 4 regarding the feedback that we are going to get from the showcase and how we will incorporate this for our final draft. The questions we included in the survey we specifically designed in order to get focused feedback about certain parts of the game. Speaking with players at the showcase as well as getting their feedback from the survey will be the main driver for what we have to do for progress report 4. 

## Outline plans to meet goals
1. What tasks are required to meet the goals you have for your next checkpoint?
    The main tasks that are required to meet the goals for the next checkpoint is the most important skill for a Game Designer is LISTENING. This is where this fact really comes into play. It is important to not get defensive when people are critiqing our game because their feedback is important and can help us improve the player experience for other people. We will also be aware to answer any questions that people have about the game and remaining engagged is important. Therefore, active listening and being able to communicate with each about how we are going to use the feedback we get from the show case into the final version of our game are the most important tasks. 
2. How are you delegating those tasks? Who is responsible for what?
    This phase 4 is something that we are all resposible for. Each of us may hear different points of feedback, or have different ideas from the showcase for how we can improve the game. Therefore, this part is something that we all need to work together on in our discussion towards what edits we are going to make for the final version of our game. s
