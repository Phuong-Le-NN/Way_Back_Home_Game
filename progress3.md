# Progress Report 3

## Summarize proposed goals and prior feedback
1. What goals did you originally plan to meet by this deadline? How did you delegate tasks to meet those goals?

Goals: Loop back and incorporate the feedback from the demo day
We will be working to adjust our game to feedback that we have from the last report. In this phase we will put the music in and refine our game interface. As the game is coming to an end, we will start thinking about the balance of our game and if there is anything we should do better.

Member’s Responsibility: Everyone will be coding together like pair programming throughout the game but each member may have different side tasks.
Phuong Le: Ensure the game can build with the last level + enhance UI and wrapping up last level if needed
Oghap Kim: Prepare the materials needed with good citation and back-ups. For this level, it will be any extra key and platform and enemies appearance as well as any extra obstacle we decide to add or slides and polishing demo documents we decide to put together.
Caroline Cavalier: Take note throughout the development process and of any changes that we decide to have in the meetings
Annie Pfeufer: Main driver when we pair programming of this level

2. What feedback did you receive on your last progress report? How did you incorporate that feedback?

        One of the main pieces of feedback that we recieved from the second progress report is that we need to update our asset.md file. In order to not be completely scrambling at the very end, we need to add all of the assets that we used to the md file. There were a couple pieces of important feedback from the in class game demos, that we thougth was important to take note of here. The first was incorporating the story more so into the game and maybe adding instruction pages between each of the levels in order to give the player more context. We also got questions about the underworld level, and how it was going to contribute to the story and how it might change the ending. There were also questions surrounding the background and platforms - was the dog climbing a mountain, etc? Thinking about the platform assets in the game and how they contribute to the story was an important piece of feedback that we recieved. Regarding having the different character options and their different abiltiies, we ultimately decided to keep them somewhat balanced because the two players will have different advantages, such as one of them will be fast but not able to jump as high, and the other one will have the opposite. Additionally, we got a reccomendation that we should label the health bar in order to makw it more noticeable for the player on the screen. To address this, we decided to add a label to the healthbar in each level. Finally, we got the question of if there will be squireels in the underworld, and to answer this - no there will not be. We wanted to keep this mechanic of the game uniquely to that level.  


## Evaluate progress made since last progress report
1. Which of the goals you outlined for this point in your last progress report have been met? Which have you made progress toward but not yet met?
3. What strategies have been working well for your group? What successes have you had? Are you ready for the showcase?
4. Did you run into any issues in this part of this project? What were those issues? What have you done to try to address them?

## Set/refine goals for next checkpoint
1. What were your original goals for the next checkpoint?
2. Do you need to modify those original goals? If so, what are your new goals?

## Outline plans to meet goals
1. What tasks are required to meet the goals you have for your next checkpoint?
2. How are you delegating those tasks? Who is responsible for what?
