# Progress Report 1

## Summarize proposed goals and prior feedback
1. What goals did you originally plan to meet by this deadline? How did you delegate tasks to meet those goals?

The goals we outlined at this stage in our initial proposal were to complete the base material and develop the game up to the intro jump scene. This included creating a functioning jumping mechanic and integrating enemies with finalized materials and designs. This would make up more than 50% of our game, aligning with the 50% rule and providing us with a version that is closer to publishable.

To accomplish this, we divided the work evenly by splitting approximately half of the entire game into equal sections, assigning each team member specific scenes to develop. The task distribution was as follows:
- Start & Character Selection Scene – Annie
- First Scene & Load Scene – Phuong
- Locked Door Scene – Caroline
- Enemy Design & Scene – Oghap

2. What feedback did you receive on your proposal? How did you incorporate that feedback?

One of the main things mentioned in the feedback was that while we described the core mechanics pretty well, we could’ve gone into more detail, especially about when lives are lost (like falling off a platform or getting hit by an acorn). We’ve started to clarify those mechanics and make sure they’re included in our planning and documentation.

There was also a question about whether the helper cat character had been cut. That made us realize we needed to decide if and how we want to include that character, so we’ve been discussing different ways to work it into the game, maybe as a guide or support element where the player can read.

We were also encouraged to explain the Time and Speed modes more clearly and to give a detailed outline of each level. We’ve started building a level-by-level plan that shows what each level includes, what the player needs to do, and how the challenges increase over time. This has made it easier to delegate tasks and stay organized.

Lastly, the feedback suggested that we tie our game more directly to concepts we’ve learned in class, like intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation and player needs. We’re now looking at how our game elements (like difficulty modes and progression) connect to ideas like flow and player satisfaction, and we’ll be updating our design to reflect that.

## Evaluate progress made since proposal
1. Which of the goals you outlined for this point in your initial proposal have been met? Which have you made progress toward but not yet met?

The goals we outlined for this point in our initial proposal were:
Complete base material and start scene up to intro jump scene as well as making a functioning jumping game where there are enemies with decided material and design (basically everything except from the add-ons for characters, speed, etc). This is more than 50% of our game and we should somewhat have a publishable version according to the 50% rule.
In our initial proposal, we aimed to complete the base material and begin development up to the intro jump scene, including a functioning jumping mechanic and enemies with finalized material and design. This would represent more than 50% of our game and provide a version that could be considered somewhat publishable. All the goals we outlined have been met. While the game is not yet fully polished, the core functionality we intended such as jumping mechanics, enemy design, and the intro scene, is complete and functioning as expected.

2. What strategies have been working well for your group? What successes have you had?

One of our most effective strategies has been maintaining active communication through Google Chat, which serves as our main collaboration tool. By regularly checking in and updating each other on progress, we were able to quickly resolved issues and members were able to help others when needed.

3. Did you run into any issues in the first part of this project? What were those issues? What have you done to try to address them?

Early in the project, we ran into an issue with not having a consistent template. Since we divided the work evenly, each team member started using different characters and backgrounds when they initially started to work on their parts. This led to inconsistencies in the game. To resolve this, we sent links and images to our groupchat to decide on a set of images, assets, and scribes, which created a cohesive design afor the entire project.


## Set/refine goals for next checkpoint
1. What were your original goals for the next checkpoint?

The original goals for this checkpoint include to complete base material and start scene set up to to the intro jump scene as well as make a functioning jumping game where there are enemies with the materials and design that we decided upon. This can include things such as the add on's and character, speed, etc. Overall, our goals for this checkpoint were fairly broad and included getting a skeleton of the game to a baseline of a playable version, but we did not outline very specifically what baselines for each of the levels we wanted to complete. I think for our next checkpoint, we need to be more specific of the development goals for each of the levels. 

2. Do you need to modify those original goals? If so, what are your new goals?

The ways in which need to modify the original goals are to add to them. As a team, we agreed that we were able to go above and beyond the baseline goals outlined in the Final Game Proposal Document. What we decided to do was to assign each of the levels/scenes to each member of the team. We set a deadline (Thursday) that the scene needed to be to a level of 50% playability. We determined this by having the basic functionality of the primary mechanic for each of the scenes done. So for example, the locked door level, the primary goal was to figure out the functionality of the locked door with the key. The more finite design and fine tuning of the aesthetics and more niche mechanics will be done at later stages. The overall primary goal that we decided for each level for phase 1 was to complete the basic functionality for the level that we were each assigned. Moving forward, we are plan to be more specific in who and what needs to be done for each progress report. Our new goals are the following:
    1. figure out why each level is so laggy
    2. figure out platform configuration
    3. make sure that the characters actually change from the character selection page. 
    4. keep assets.md updated as we continue to modify the game. 
    5. focus on fine tuning each of the aesthetic details of each level, and since the baseline functionality is there, be more critical of editing process.
