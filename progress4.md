# Progress Report 4

## Summarize proposed goals and prior feedback
1. What was the essential experience you inteded for playtesters to have at the showcase? Think all the way back to your initial proposal.
    As outlined in our original proposal, the essential experience and unifying theme of our game were as follows: 
    
    When discussing the different ideas for our final game, a commonality that we all had was the ways in which dogs have improved the quality of our lives. Whether we have owned our own pet dogs, played with them or watched movies and television shows with them, we all agreed that dogs are an essential part of our happiness in life. When we see them on campus, they all light up our day. Therefore, we wanted to build our final game around providing the player with the essential experience surrounded by the joy and fulfillment that dogs bring us. There is a sense of innocence and childhood nostalgia that we all described when talking about how dogs made us feel. We want to portray this in our game by not only including the theme of dogs, but also designing a game with details that bring the player back to childhood. Games such as PacMan and Super Mario Bros are some of the games that we have looked to for inspiration.
	
    Regarding the unifying game theme, we are going to construct all of our levels based on the idea of a jump map. Each level will get consistently harder with moving platforms, object collection and enemies shooting at you. The idea is that the player will learn new skills at each level that they can use to pass the more difficult levels as the game continues. We wanted to have a consistent theme through the incorporation of the dogs, but also the type of game being the jump-map remaining the same in terms of foundation throughout the duration of the game. 

2. What feedback did you receive at the showcase?
    
    There were a couple of different questions on the feedback form that we got assessed on. The following are the different questions we asked on the survey form, and the general responses that we got from them.

    1. Do you want the character to have more options for movement?
        Although there were a couple of responses that said yes, and requested movements such as rolling, crouching and even swimming, the majority of responses said no. A lot of people preferred that keeping the game simpler was the best way to go. 

    2. Did the character's motion feel natural?
        To our surprise, most people responded yes to this question. Many people said that for a character in the video game, the motion of the character feels very natural and enjoyable. Some people did say that there was some glitchiness when the dog was on the edge of the platform and sort of got stuck. To solve this, some people found that by pressing the space bar more than once helped them get onto the platform. 
    
    3. How did the game make you feel? Was the ending rewarding?
        Everyone except for one person said that the game was rewarding, and fun. Some of the different reasons for why people said it was fun is because it challenged them, the music and dog character was rewarding throughout the gameplay experience. Some people thought it was relaxing while others felt like their heart rate got up while playing the enemy against the squirrel. It was interesting to see that people found the game interesting and enjoyable for different reasons. Overall, people thought the game was an adventurous experienced that had different challenges depending on the player's skill level. 

    4. What advice do you have for this team? Were any parts of this game frustraing?
        Some people said that the jump mechanic was a bit glitchy at times, and that it would have beeb helpful if there was an instructins on the double jump abilities as well as the controls to click to move the character. Some people also wanted unlimited lives or more levels. There were also different comments surrounding the layouts of the levels, for example what to do after the player got the key and where they should go next. This was not an issue for everyone, but got brought up a couple of times. These were the majority of the points of feedback that we got on this question.

    5. What did the team do well and what did you enjoy about this game?
        A lot of people really enjoyed the different aesthetics such as the music, graphics and characters. Some people also commented on how the storytelling added to the experience and explained some of the different levels and how to get through them better. People also liked the ability to choose a character and said that the organization of the game was easy and straightforward. This is an overall summary of the parts of the game that people enjoyed the most. 


## Evaluate showcase feedback
1. Did the feedback confirm anything you already suspected?

    The feedback confirmed several things that our team had already suspected. Many participants commented on the jumping mechanics, specifically noting that the jump felt awkward or "wonky," especially when trying to land on platform edges. This aligns with concerns we previously had about the gameplay physics. Additionally, the overall reaction to the game’s aesthetic was very positive! Players described it as fun and easy to pick up, which suggests that our goal of creating a user-friendly experience was successfully achieved. There were also repeated compliments on the storyline and the design of the dog characters, which was especially encouraging as those were key elements that our group wanted to highlight in our game.

2. Did it tell you anything new?

    Yes, the feedback revealed several new aspects of the game that we hadn’t fully considered before. A number of players pointed out issues with the storytelling screens, such as the text blending into the background, and small "OK" buttons that were easy to miss. These concerns weren't on our radar but are definitely worth addressing. Additionally, several players showed interest in expanded movement options such as dashing or rolling which could make the gameplay more dynamic and engaging. It was also interesting to hear that some players actually enjoyed the platforming bugs, like clinging to platform edges or jumping on floating objects, interpreting them as fun elements rather than flaws. Finally, the character balance between the corgi and the dalmatian raised a new concern. While we intended for both dogs to offer unique play styles, many players felt the dalmatian was objectively better, suggesting we may need to adjust their abilities to keep the balance between them.

3. Are there questions you still have that are unanswered?

    Yes, the feedback leaves us with a few questions. One key area of uncertainty is the game’s difficulty level. While some players appreciated the simplicity, others wanted a greater challenge or more complex levels. Our group questions about how much difficulty we should introduce in future updates without losing the current feel of the game. Another question is how much we should invest in polishing the storytelling interface. While some players were distracted by the layout, it's unclear whether improving these elements would significantly enhance the experience or just be a minor upgrade. We’re also still wondering how to better communicate character differences and whether it’s worth rebalancing the gameplay to make the corgi and dalmatian more equal.
