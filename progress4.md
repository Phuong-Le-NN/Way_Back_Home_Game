# Progress Report 4

## Summarize proposed goals and prior feedback
1. What was the essential experience you inteded for playtesters to have at the showcase? Think all the way back to your initial proposal.
    As outlined in our original proposal, the essential experience and unifying theme of our game were as follows: 
    
    When discussing the different ideas for our final game, a commonality that we all had was the ways in which dogs have improved the quality of our lives. Whether we have owned our own pet dogs, played with them or watched movies and television shows with them, we all agreed that dogs are an essential part of our happiness in life. When we see them on campus, they all light up our day. Therefore, we wanted to build our final game around providing the player with the essential experience surrounded by the joy and fulfillment that dogs bring us. There is a sense of innocence and childhood nostalgia that we all described when talking about how dogs made us feel. We want to portray this in our game by not only including the theme of dogs, but also designing a game with details that bring the player back to childhood. Games such as PacMan and Super Mario Bros are some of the games that we have looked to for inspiration.
	
    Regarding the unifying game theme, we are going to construct all of our levels based on the idea of a jump map. Each level will get consistently harder with moving platforms, object collection and enemies shooting at you. The idea is that the player will learn new skills at each level that they can use to pass the more difficult levels as the game continues. We wanted to have a consistent theme through the incorporation of the dogs, but also the type of game being the jump-map remaining the same in terms of foundation throughout the duration of the game. 

2. What feedback did you receive at the showcase?
    
    There were a couple of different questions on the feedback form that we got assessed on. The following are the different questions we asked on the survey form, and the general responses that we got from them.

    1. Do you want the character to have more options for movement?
        Although there were a couple of responses that said yes, and requested movements such as rolling, crouching and even swimming, the majority of responses said no. A lot of people preferred that keeping the game simpler was the best way to go. 

    2. Did the character's motion feel natural?
        To our surprise, most people responded yes to this question. Many people said that for a character in the video game, the motion of the character feels very natural and enjoyable. Some people did say that there was some glitchiness when the dog was on the edge of the platform and sort of got stuck. To solve this, some people found that by pressing the space bar more than once helped them get onto the platform. 
    
    3. How did the game make you feel? Was the ending rewarding?
