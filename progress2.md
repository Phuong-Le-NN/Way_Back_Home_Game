# Progress Report 2

## Summarize proposed goals and prior feedback
1. What goals did you originally plan to meet by this deadline? How did you delegate tasks to meet those goals?

The goals that we originally plan to meet for this deadline include the following: 

    Start & Character Selection Scene – Annie Make the character selection system actually select different characters for each of the level.
    
    First Scene & Load Scene – Phuong Focus on fine tuning smaller mechanics and also continue playtesting and functionality.
    
    Locked Door Scene – Caroline Need to look into the lagginess of the jumping of the player. Also, the player can sort of go off the the platforms and not fall off. This needs to change to ensure that if the player is not actually on the platform, then they should fall. Additionally, for some reason when the player fell, the game did not automatically start over and this needs to be looked into. Also focus on arranging platforms to make it more difficult and continue to fine tune the level.
    
    Enemy Design & Scene – Oghap Making player experience more smooth and figuring out, when it dies are we going to restart the level or game over. We also need to meet with our composer to determine how we are going to incorporate the sounds into the game, and also need to work on the final scene when the puppy returns home as well and the game ends.

2. What feedback did you receive on your last progress report? How did you incorporate that feedback?
    One of the pieces of feedback that we got on our last progress report was helping us figure out how to restart the game when the player fell. Dr.Currin reccommended putting in a platform that can detect a collision when the player falls, and then this can be triggered to have a re-spawn occur. This feedback was very helpful, and we ended up incorporating an if check into the code to see if the player position went below a certain height on the y axis, then we would set the position back at the start of the game. Another key issue that we were looking to solve is data persistance between scene issue. This was was going to be something that we had to run into because we had planned to keep the same player throughout all of the scenes, after the player made the original character selection in the beginnning of the game. Dr. Currin provided a helpful tutorial in the feedback from phase 1 that helped us deal with this issue when we were working on this issue. Annie worked on resolving this issue in phase 2. Another data persitance issue we were running into when we were working on this phase was having a health bar be consistent across all of the levels, but this was not happening because we reloaded the scene every time the player fell. Instead of this, we decided to just move the player's position every time they fell to go back to the start. Overall, the feedback we got from dealing with the data persistance issue was very helpful for this phase. Finally, a question that Dr.Currin had for us is how we are going to communicate the lives left to the player. To deal with this, we created a health bar that can be seen in each of the levels. We may want to add a title to this, so the player can clearly understand what the healthbar is. 

## Evaluate progress made since last progress report
1. Which of the goals you outlined for this point in your last progress report have been met? Which have you made progress toward but not yet met?
    For the start and and character selection scene, Annie has been working on the data persistance of keeping the character the same throughout each of the levels. We had not originally thought that this was going to be an issue, but when figuring out the player details, this is something that we needed to figure out before the demo, so that we had at least one of the characters working. The corgi is working, and a goal that we have for the next progress report is to have the second player character option working, 
    First and Load Scene (Phuong here is where you can add your updates to this goal)
    Locked Door Scene : For this scene, we changed around the jump map setup to have a bit more of the pattern to the way that the plaforms are laid out. We were also able to figure out how to start the scene over when the player fell, and were successfully able to reset its position. We also added a panel to the game, so that when the player fell too many times, that the healthbar ran out, there is a panel that pops up and tells the player that they lost the game, and when they hit replay the game starts over. We still need to figure out some of the smaller design details with the platforms, because the player is able to sort of run into or like float somewhat off the platform when you are jumoing between the platform. 
    Enemy Design and Scene (Oghap here is where you can fill out updates to this goal).
    Underworld Scene: There is also a secret (sort of) level that has moving platforms and looks different UI wise from the other levels. When working with our composer, he had mentioned that he actually really liked that scene and reccommended that we keep it in the game. We once again need to refine the aesthetics of this scene a bit, but it does have a strong foundation. 
    Meeting with Composer: We were also all able to meet with our composer to decide on a track for the game, and learning how to incorporate that into our next game is going to be one of our goals for the next phase. 
2. What strategies have been working well for your group? What successes have you had? Are you ready for your demo?
    The delegation of tasks has been working well for our group. We are able to give each other specific parts of the game to work on, but then when we meet as a whole group we are able to ask for help on problems that we are running into within each of our tasks. This also allows us to set clear deadlines of when we want things to be done before we all meet as a group. Another strategy that has been working well is our communication. We are all able to trust each other ennough to ask questions and be honest when we are struggling and need help with different things. One of the biggest successes that we have had has been adapting. There have been a couple issues that we have run into that did not think about or plan for, such as the data persistance issue with the characters. Our ability to adapt to these changes has been a strength of the group and has allowed us to be successful in gettng work done. Another success that our group shas had is being able to ask for help. When we are struggling, we are able to deal with it somewhat quickly because we clearly communicate with each other when something is going wrong. We are ready for our demo on Wednesday. We have all of the key elements that we want advice on from Spencer Brooks ready to go. For example, we want to know if it is better to have the bush platforms, or rather to have more of a rectangle platform. We also decided that the question we are going to ask is regarding if there is any point in the game that the player loses interest. 

4. Did you run into any issues in this part of this project? What were those issues? What have you done to try to address them?
    We ran into the data persistance issue of having the character selection remain consistent throughout the duration of the project. Although this was an issue we had originally thought about, we were able to deal with it by talking to Dr. Currin and using a tutorial to help learn how to keep the character the same throughout each of the levels. Another issue that we ran into was having the game not reset at the first level. For some of the reason, the Replay button was not working accurately and did not send the player back to start of the game when the health bar ran out. To solve this, we had to manually set up the button on that level instead of just copying and pasting the panel from other levels. This wasn't necessarily an issue, but something we ran into was coming up with a question for the demo. We wanted to ask about if there was a point in the game that the player lost interest, but we did not want it to sound like a leading question. To deal with this, we talked to Dr. Currin about how we could rephrase this in order to make it not a leading question, but also give the person who is providing feedback room to elaborate. From this, we were able to come up with a question that was not a leading question, but also allowed us to get the information that we wanted. 

## Set/refine goals for next checkpoint
1. What were your original goals for the next checkpoint?

The original goals from the propsal document for phase 3 include: 

oals: Ready to demo where we can show the alumni the acorn and squirrels with the different, special add-ons for the speed and characters. This is the rest 50% of our game and in case we need some time to wiggle and need to postpone, we should still have a publishable version to demo.
Add-ons include timer and very fast speed into this game to add difficulty (and may be some fun frustration) as well as adding final touch to things, including sound and some game effects as we reflect to ensure the best user experience possible.
We will also be working to adjust our game to feedback that we have from the last report and make any changes in design to better our game.

2. Do you need to modify those original goals? If so, what are your new goals?
