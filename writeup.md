# Final Writeup


1. What was the original plan you had for your game? How does the game you created resemble and differ from it? Use Schell's tetrad to describe these similarities and differences.
  
   Original essential experience and theme:
      
   When discussing the different ideas for our final game, a commonality that we all had was the ways in which dogs have improved the quality of our lives. Whether we have owned our own pet dogs, played with them or watched movies and television shows with them, we all agreed that dogs are an essential part of our happiness in life. When we see them on campus, they all light up our day. Therefore, we wanted to build our final game around providing the player with the essential experience surrounded by the joy and fulfillment that dogs bring us. There is a sense of innocence and childhood nostalgia that we all described when talking about how dogs made us feel. We want to portray this in our game by not only including the theme of dogs, but also designing a game with details that bring the player back to childhood. Games such as PacMan and Super Mario Bros are some of the games that we have looked to for inspiration.
  
    Regarding the unifying game theme, we are going to construct all of our levels based on the idea of a jump map. Each level will get consistently harder with moving platforms, object collection and enemies shooting at you. The idea is that the player will learn new skills at each level that they can use to pass the more difficult levels as the game continues. We wanted to have a consistent theme through the incorporation of the dogs, but also the type of game being the jump-map remaining the same in terms of foundation throughout the duration of the game.


   Original Mechanics as laid out in our proposal in the beginning of the semester :


   Original Mechanic : Progressive Learning Curve: Each level will introduce a new skill that the player must learn to complete the level. This means that each level will be more difficult, but also enabling a natural progression through the game.
   What Actually Happened : This is a mechanic that we were able to maintain throughout the creation and design of the game. As we developed each of the levels, we wanted each of them to get harder so the player could become more used to it over time and be able to successfully complete the later levels. Each of the different levels introduced a new mechanic/ challenge that the player would need to figure out to solve, on top of completing the jumo map and finishing the level.


   Moving Platforms and Object Collection: Early levels ease players in with simple platform moving and key-collection mechanics. More specifically, the player will need to collect a key about halfway through one of the levels in order to unlock the door at the end of the level in order to move on with the game.
   What Actually Happened : This is another mechanic that we kept for the final web build of the game. The second level involves the player finding the key, and then continuing to jump to find the gate where they can use the key to unlock it and move to the next level. This level did not include the moving platforms, but the level after it does. We ended up using a game that we built for the 2D platformer game, and used this as a sort of underworld level. In this level, the platforms moved and the player still had to get to the cat. Therefore, we incorporated both of these levels in the final game. 


   Shooting Mechanics: Players must dodge or counter enemies that are squirrels shooting at them. This adds an action mechanic to the game that the player must adapt to in order to complete the final level.
   What Actually Happened :The final level that the player must pass before they reach the end is a shooter level, where a squirrel is firing acorns at them, and they must dodge them or they will lose health.
  
   Time Mode and Speed Challenges: Some levels will test reflexes and adaptability of the player by adding time and speed challenges which will require the player to engage with the game even towards the middle and end.
   What Actually Happened : We ended up adding a timer onto the underground level with the moving platforms to add an additional layer of difficulty. We did set this timer to a pretty generous amount of time (1:30), and many of the players at the showcase were able to pass this level in the allotted amount of time. For speed challenges, one of the ways we did this was giving the different character options in the game different advantages. For example, the dalmation could run much faster than the corgi, and some players preferred the dalmation while others liked the corgi because they felt like they were able to control it better.


   Theme Consistency: Dogs remain central, reinforcing the theme through visuals, sound design and interactive elements (collection dog treats as rewards, instead of just regular coins.)
   What Actually Happened : Theme consistency was something that remained constant throughout the design process. We knew that we wanted our unifying theme to be dogs, and focusing on the whole journey home aspect. We didn't really do a reward system that involved collecting treats, as mentioned in our original proposal. A story that we built upon was the whole dog chasing a cat, and in order to move onto the next level you had to reach the cat Arlo in order to move on. The overall story and theme were reinforced through checkpoints on each level that provided the player with instructions and also details from the story as well. The background scenery was pixelated and nature filled because we wanted to create a cozy and comforting visual experience for the player. The pixelated dog character was an essential element of our game because we wanted to provide a very retro, indie style jump map game for our players that hopefully creates a level of nostalgia.


   Player Autonomy: We will allow the player at the beginning of the game to choose their player. We will give them two options of characters that they can be throughout the duration of the game.
   What Actually Happened: This is exactly what we ended up doing for the final version of the game. We had two different dog options including a corgi and dalmation that the player could choose from. The dalmation ran faster and the corgi lost less health because it has a thicker coat. Overall, we wanted the player to be able to choose whichever character they wanted when they played our game.


   Number of Lives: The player will have a set number of lives (we think 5, but in playtesting this might change depending on how difficult the levels are to pass in order to make it fair for the player), and if they lose all of their lives then they will start the game over from the first level.
   What Actually Happened : Instead of a specific number of lives, we incorporated a health bar on each level that reset after the player completed a level. We thought that the health bar would provide a visual representation to the player of how much health they had left, rather than just a number of lives that may not be as visually apparent during game play. We also thought that having the health bar reset at the end of each level made it a slightly more fair player experience that could accommodate players of all experiences. With this said, if the player does run out of health they have to start the entire game over and not just the level. We thought this was a good way to balance the difficulty of the game.


   Storyline: The game tells a lighthearted, nostalgic story about a dog trying to find its way home. Players will navigate various environments, facing increasingly difficult challenges along the Ruff Road home.
   What Actually Happened : The overall storyline remained the same. A dog had been chasing squirrels and then all of a sudden they were lost and needed to find their way home. One of the more difficult things through developing our game was making sure the storyline was evident, and that the levels of the game fit in well with the storyline. At the demo with the GM of Games at Netflix, we didn't have different checkpoints that explained the storyline and it was a little bit confusing. Therefore, we added different checkpoints that explained the levels and how they connect to the storyline. For example, in the underground level, the instruction panel tells the player that they have fallen into a hole and must get out before the timer runs out. Developing the different levels and planning how they connect to the storyline was a constant, changing process throughout the design of our game.
  
   Start Scene: The game will begin with an introduction to the journey to the dog and its goal - which will be made clear that the dog will go back home.
   What Actually Happened : In our final version, we have a title page for our game that says, "Ruff Road Home" and has pastel, light warm colors in the background. Then, we have to choose your character scene that has a very similar aesthetic. Next, we have an instruction page that goes a bit more into the story and sets the stage for the player before they begin the game. Then finally, there is an instruction panel for the first level that the player must read before they play, and then the game begins. We wanted to both set the scene, and introduce the player to the game at the very beginning so they would have a foundational understanding before playing the rest of the game.
  
   Mid-Level Challenges: Each level represents an obstacle the dog must overcome, from escaping a maze to dodging acorns from angry squirrels.
   What Actually Happened :
   Level 1 : Simple jump map, where the player must get to the cat to reach the next level.
   Level 2 : The player must find a key and then find a gate where Arlo the cat is sitting. Using the key to unlock the gate, the player will move to the next level.
   Level 3 : An underground level involving moving platforms and a timer counting down from 1:30.
   Level 4 : Players must reach arlo while there are flying acorns being shot at them that cause a loss in health.
  
   Final Scene: The game ends with a heartwarming scene in which the dog finally reaches home. We want this to make the player feel fulfilled in their commitment to helping the dog get home.
   What Actually Happened : This is exactly what we ended up doing for our final scene. There are many flowers, and a warm pastel background. There is also a house, and the player can see both Arlo and the character outside the house indicating that the dog got home and the player won the game.


2. Were you able to make the changes you planned in your final progress report? What issues did you run into in this final stretch? What successes did you have?
        We were able to successfully make the changes that we planned in our final progress report. One of the main issues that we were running into is that people would not read the instructions before playing the game, and press the okay button cause you could still see the player with the instruction screen. In order to solve this issue, we changed the color of both the instrution panels on each level and the game over panel so that the player is not able to see the character and continue to play the game when it is over, or before they have read the instructions at the beginning of each level. 

        Another issue that we were running into on the web build during the showcase is that the size of the text was not big enough. Therefore, we changed the size of the text throughout the game including the instructions for each level, as well as the story text on each of the scenes before the player entered the level. 

        Another fix that we had to make was ensuring that the very first scene we created showed up in the web build. The scene that actually says 'Ruff Road Home' was not showing up in thw web build, but we were able to fix this for the final version of the game. 

        Finally, the last change we made was having a restart button on the corner of the screen, to give the player an option on whether or not they wanted to restart the game at a random point to either change characters or just begin playing again. This change was slightly more difficult to make rather than just the text size and coloring of the panels, but we were successfully able to implement this change to give the player further autonomy in optimizing their player experience. 

3. What changes would you make if you had an extra week? An extra month?

    - One change that we would make is expanding on the game by adding more levels. Due to the length of the development time, as well as how many minutes we had (around 5) that it should take in order for a player to complete our game for the showcase, we were limited in the amount of levels that we could make. Even a piece of feedback that we got had asked for more levels and different challenges. This could be something that could be expanded upon if we had more time with the addition of new challenges and quests that the player could be able to do. 
    - Another change that we would make is expanding on the music and sound effects throughout the game. We could add sound effects including when an acorn would hit the player, or when the player gets the key on the second level. Additionally, it would also be interesting to add different music on each level of the game that reflected the further challenges that occured as you went through the different levels. Overall, more time being spent on the sound effects could add to the overall juciness and satisifaction that the player gets when playing the game. 
    - Some of the feedback that we recieved was adding some point of rewards system that allowed the player to level up or something like that. This is a feature that we did not really have time to implement on top of our other mechanics, but this could be a good way to develop our game, espcially if we had more levels. Since each of the different charactes have different abilities, this could be another way to build upon this idea. Providing the player with different options to level up and enhance their capabilities could appear to more experienced game players because it provides more options, but could also help less experienced game players by giving them a leg up to help them pass certain levels. 
    - Another change that we would make if we had more time is giving more character options for the player. This was a question that came up quite frequenly at the showcase, and by providng more options to players on which characters they could choose, this could enhance their experience while also providing them with more autonomy while playing the game. Maybe even adding an option to play as another character such as a cat to satisfy all of the cat people who may play our game. 
    - Another thing that we might change is the ability to double jump, or at least mentioning it. There were some people who were able to figure it out when they were on the edge of a platform, but others weren't able to really figure it out. This wasn't really an intended figure, so maybe we could have developed this a little bit more as an intended feature. 
    - Finally, one last change that we could consider making is changing the platforms on each of the levels. We kept them the same on each of the levels to create a more unifying look and also had random sponning for the placement of these platforms. To build on this, we could have longer platforms and different obstacles on these platforms for the players to able to navigate. Overall, this could help build on the aesthetics and player experience of our game for future versions. 
4. Think back over the whole process of making this game. How did you use the lenses and principles we learned in class in creating and improving your game?
