# Final Projects

This is the repository for your final projects. One team member should clone this repository, create a Unity project, move the gitignore into the project folder, and commit and push the project. 

Be proactive in communicating about who will work on which pieces of the project and when. Pull before making changes to make sure you are working with the most up to date version of the project. Push your changes each time you get a new feature working. Atlassian has a lot of useful guides about managing workflows on group projects with git (for example, [Comparing Git workflows: What you should know](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)).

Your commit history should show incremental progress. As a group, you will be responsible for completing and submitting four progress reports over the course of the semester. Below is what is expected at each checkpoint:
